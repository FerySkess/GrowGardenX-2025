## 🧠 How It Works (Legal, Educational, and Dev-Friendly)

GrowGardenX is a *helper script* that runs as a local development utility or can be used by server owners for controlled game modes. It does **not** exploit game security or modify Roblox server binaries. Use GrowGardenX to:

1. Load the script into a local test environment or a trusted private server (developer tools recommended).
2. Configure seed lists, garden layout, watering intervals, and growth multipliers in `config.lua`.
3. Run simulated growth cycles, inspect logs, and export data for balance tuning or content creation.

> Note: This project is intended for **education, testing, and roleplay servers**. Always comply with Roblox Terms of Service and server rules.
